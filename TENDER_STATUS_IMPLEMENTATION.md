# Tender Status System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive tender status management system with proper database schema and API endpoints.

## Database Changes

### Status Reference Table
- Created `status` table with predefined status types:
  1. OPEN - Tender is accepting proposals
  2. AWARDING - Tender evaluation in progress  
  3. FINISHED - Tender process completed

### Tender Table Enhancements
- Added `status_id` column (references status table, defaults to 1 = OPEN)
- Added `finished_at` timestamp column for tracking completion
- Safe migration logic that checks for existing columns

## API Endpoints

### New Tender Status Routes (`/api/tender-status/`)
1. `GET /tenders` - Get all tenders with status information
2. `GET /stats` - Get tender statistics by status
3. `GET /expired` - Get expired tenders (past deadline but still OPEN)
4. `POST /update-expired` - Automatically update expired tenders to AWARDING
5. `POST /:id/finish` - Mark a tender as FINISHED
6. `GET /status/:statusId` - Get tenders by specific status

### Enhanced Existing Routes
- `GET /api/tenders` - Now includes status information in responses
- `GET /api/tenders/:id` - Returns tender with status details  
- `GET /api/tenders/domain/:domainId` - Domain-filtered tenders with status
- `POST /api/tenders` - Creates new tenders with default OPEN status

## Key Features

### Status Management
- Proper referential integrity with status lookup table
- Default OPEN status for new tenders
- Status name included in all tender queries
- Automatic handling of expired tenders

### Database Safety  
- Safe column addition with existence checks
- Preserves existing data during migration
- Handles both fresh installations and updates

### API Consistency
- All tender endpoints now return status information
- Consistent status field naming (`status_id`, `status_name`)
- Proper error handling and validation

## Usage Examples

### Create Tender (automatically gets OPEN status)
```javascript
POST /api/tenders
// Response includes status_id: 1, status_name: "OPEN"
```

### Get Tender Statistics
```javascript
GET /api/tender-status/stats
// Returns count of tenders by status
```

### Mark Tender as Finished
```javascript  
POST /api/tender-status/123/finish
// Updates tender 123 to FINISHED status with timestamp
```

### Update Expired Tenders
```javascript
POST /api/tender-status/update-expired
// Automatically moves expired OPEN tenders to AWARDING
```

## Implementation Status

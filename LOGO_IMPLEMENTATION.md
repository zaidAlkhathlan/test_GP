# Logo Upload Feature Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete logo upload system for both buyers and suppliers that:
- Saves logos as Base64 strings in the database (not as files)
- Only allows logo changes in edit mode
- Shows real-time preview when uploading
- Persists logos across login/logout sessions
- Validates file types and sizes

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema ✅
- **Buyer table**: Already had `Logo TEXT` field 
- **Supplier table**: Already had `Logo TEXT` field
- **Added industry field**: Added `industry TEXT` column to Buyer table to match frontend expectations

### 2. Backend API Routes ✅
- **Buyer routes** (`/server/routes/buyers.ts`):
  - Updated `updateBuyer` to handle logo field mapping
  - Added field mapping from frontend `logo` to database `Logo`
  - Added support for `industry` field
  
- **Supplier routes** (`/server/routes/suppliers.ts`):
  - Already had proper logo field mapping
  - Confirmed logo update functionality works

### 3. Frontend Implementation ✅
- **CompanyProfile component** (`/client/pages/CompanyProfile.tsx`):
  
  #### New State Variables:
  ```typescript
  const [logoFile, setLogoFile] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const [logoPreview, setLogoPreview] = useState<string | null>(null);
  ```
  
  #### Logo Upload Handler:
  - `handleLogoChange()` function converts image files to Base64
  - Validates file types (JPG, PNG, GIF)
  - Validates file size (max 2MB)
  - Only works when `isEditing` is true
  
  #### UI Updates:
  - Logo display shows preview when uploading
  - "تغيير الشعار" button only clickable in edit mode
  - Visual indicator (green checkmark) when logo is selected
  - Cancel edit properly resets logo changes

  #### Profile Save Function:
  - Includes logo in profile update API call
  - Updates localStorage with new logo data
  - Clears preview state after successful save

### 4. Key Features ✅

#### File Validation:
- **Allowed types**: JPG, PNG, GIF
- **Max size**: 2MB
- **Error messages**: Arabic error messages for invalid files

#### Edit Mode Control:
- Logo upload only available when editing profile
- Button shows as disabled with explanatory text when not editing
- All changes can be canceled, reverting logo to original

#### Base64 Storage:
- Files converted to Base64 strings before saving
- Stored directly in database `Logo` field
- No file system dependencies
- Works well with multiple buyers/suppliers

#### Persistence:
- Logo data saved to localStorage after successful update
- Persists across browser sessions
- Available immediately after login

## 🎯 How It Works

### User Flow:
1. User clicks "تعديل الملف الشخصي" (Edit Profile)
2. "تغيير الشعار" (Change Logo) button becomes clickable
3. User clicks button → file picker opens
4. User selects image → preview shows with green checkmark
5. User clicks "حفظ التغييرات" (Save Changes) → logo saved to database
6. Logo persists across logout/login

### Technical Flow:
```typescript
File Selection → Base64 Conversion → Preview Display → 
API Update → Database Storage → localStorage Update
```
